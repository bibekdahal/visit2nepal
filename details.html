        <div class="overview">
            <p>
                Everest Base Camp trek is one of the most popular treks in Nepal. It epitomizes by far the finest trekking experience in the Himalayas, whose premier objective is to see Mt. Everest, the worldâ€™s highest mountain at 8848m, along with Ama Dablam, Cho Oyu, Lhotse, Nuptse among others.
            </p>

            <p>
                Add to that, the unique and colorful Sherpa culture, the visit to 500 year old Thyangboche Monastery, the pristine wilderness of Sagarmatha National Park and the trek to Kalapatthar at an altitude of 5643m to see the majestic sunrise over Everest.
            </p>

            <p>
                Everest Base Camp trek begins in Lukla, the gateway to the Everest region, and ends with a challenging walk to Everest Base Camp (5364m). Our trail passes through Sherpa villages with well cultivated fields and small hamlets, interspersed with magnificent forests of rhododendron, magnolia and giant firs. We will have a fascinating experience of watching the hustle and bustle of Namche Bazaar- famously called the capital of Sherpas- and a touch of modernity it creates. A few hours walk from Namche would bring us to Thyanboche Monastery, an incredible spiritual center in the heart of Himalayas.
            </p>

            <p>
                The ascend to the summit of Kalapathar (5643m) rewards with brilliant views of Mount Everest and a breathtaking panorama of the world's highest mountains before returning to Pheriche and then back to Kathmandu.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                The EBC Trek can be organized at varying times of the year and for different duration. As such, this 14-day itinerary is the most appropriate one since it has been designed keeping in mind the issue of acclimatization and attractions.
